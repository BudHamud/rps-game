      <h1>About... Kaiji</h1>
      <p>Japan, February 1996. 3 years after graduating from high school and moving to Tokyo to get a job, Kaiji Ito fails to find a stable job due to the recession of World War II. Depressed, he stays in his apartment, fooling around with cheap jokes, gambling, alcohol, and cigarettes. Kaiji is always thinking about money and his perpetual poverty frequently brings him to tears. Kaiji's misery continues until he gets an unexpected visit from a loan shark named Yuji Endo, who wants to recover a large debt that Kaiji had signed with his co-worker. Endo gives Kaiji two options: spend the next ten years trying to pay off his huge debt, or join the gambling and board game ship "Espoir" for a day and pay off his debt. Endo pressures Kaiji to accept the offer, believing that he would never return from the trip.</p>

        The participants are taken to the ship of hope, the Espoir, where they will have to play for four hours. They are each given four Rock, four Paper, and four Scissors cards, as well as three stars and a loan for an amount of their choice between one and ten million yen. The interest is 1.5% every ten minutes. Participants must play Rock, Paper, Scissors among themselves, discarding the cards after each use. The loser must give one of their stars to the winner, and whoever runs out of stars automatically loses. At the end of time, those with three stars or more and who have already played all their cards are declared winners, and the rest are losers. The money that was loaned to them at the beginning is not included in the debt that is canceled at the beginning of the game, but if someone no longer has cards and has three or more stars before four hours, they can declare themselves the winner and pay the loan debt. of the current day with the interests as far as they have come. The losers are taken to another room and there are rumors that they are killed, used for medical experiments, or made to do forced labor for years to settle their accounts. Kaiji is swindled shortly into the game and is left with only a star and a card, but right after that he meets the man guilty of his debt to the mafia.</p>
